/**
 * @brief Map z/OS Control Block Structures for retrieving system processor
 * and memory usage statistics.  These C structures provide access to the common
 * storage area of currently running address space.  This area which is below
 * 16M bytes contains system control blocks necessary for accessing in-memory
 * system data.
 * MVS Data Areas published as part of official z/OS documentation is the basis
 * for arriving at these structures.  In particular refer to Volumes 1 and 5 for
 * the following listed mappings.  These mappings are essentially cut down
 * structures containing details only relevant to the current implementation.
 * Description of each field in a structure begins with offset:length conforming
 * the data layout published for that structure in MVS Data Areas.
 * Note 1) Fields inside each structure are named after the corresponding data
 *         area element to ensure name consistency while referring to them.
 *      2) All the data area elements employed here are validated by the
 *         respective z/OS development team for correctness and general
 *         programmable usability.
 * See JTCJAZZ 60676.
